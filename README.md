## About MarketApp

Riverbend Gardens is an established farming business with a product line of twenty responsibly-farmed vegetables. It is based in Edmonton, Alberta and serves local residents interested in local and independently produced vegetables. Its sales strategy is to sell through both community supported agriculture programs and farmers’ markets. Its principals are Aaron and Janelle Herbert.

Traditionally sales through farmers’ markets have been well however there are two areas that could be improved. The first is sales day operations which are currently managed in real-time and in person by the owners. The second is improving the product line and availability and market participation which currently is based on intuition due to a lack of sales data. The goal of this project is to improve these two areas.

Our strategy is to develop a web app which features sales day management to improve sales day operations and sales data collection to provide product and market sales metrics.
